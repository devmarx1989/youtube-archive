Michael Myers and the Halloween Franchise changed the culture of horror, and what started as a first film made by a young John Carpenter launched a wave of slashers through the next decade. This video will hopefully give some information and entertainment about the Halloween franchise. This video was a real undertaking for me to do in the past two weeks, but I wanted to do something really big for the fortieth anniversary of the franchise and just to celebrate Halloween in general, I really hope you like it, and if you do let me know if you want me to do a similar thing with other franchises, because I think that could be really fun. Happy Halloween everybody, and thanks for watching!
