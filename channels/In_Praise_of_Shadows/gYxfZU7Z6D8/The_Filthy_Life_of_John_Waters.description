Hey, hope you've been okay. Today we are looking at the career and rise within culture of filmmaker John Waters. From Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble, on up through Hairspray, Serial Mom, and Cecil B. Demented, we are going to see how he among his group of misfits including Divine, Mink Stole, Mary Vivian Pearce and David Lochary as well as many others changed culture forever. I hope you enjoy, and thank you so much for watching.
