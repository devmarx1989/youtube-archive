In today's video we are looking at the 2009 YouTube show Marble Hornets, how Slenderman was created and how he spread over the internet, as well as issues related to copyright and internet creations in relation to this through a lens of modern examples such as Sirenhead and The Backrooms. Thank you so much for watching.
