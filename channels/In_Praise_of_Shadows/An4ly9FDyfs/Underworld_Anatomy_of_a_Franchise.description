In today's franchise retrospective, we are looking at the history of the Underworld series and seeing how they utilized vampires and werewolves over time. I recently reviewed a few different werewolf films on Amazon Prime with my friend Giallo Julian through Dread Central, and if you would like to check that out you can find it in the link below. Thank you for watching.
