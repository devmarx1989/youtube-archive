In today's video, we are going to look at the past thirty years of Batman's history, and see how things have changed gradually since then. From the days of The Dark Knight Returns, Arkham Asylum, and The Killing Joke, to Grant Morrison's run in 2006 and Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo's run with the New 52. All the way to Tom King's recent stories with Batman Rebirth, I hope you like it because this one is special to me. Let me know what you think, and thanks for watching!
