The Exorcist has always been known as the scariest film of all time, and today we are going to look at why it still is. In today's horror retrospective, we look at a large history involving the Hays Code, the Universal Monsters, and we talk about how Rosemary's Baby helped launch The Exorcist to the position that it had in the american public. Thank you for watching.
