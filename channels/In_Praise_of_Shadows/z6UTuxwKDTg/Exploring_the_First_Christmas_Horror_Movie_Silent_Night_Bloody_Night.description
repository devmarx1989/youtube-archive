Growing up as a kid, I always loved movies like Gremlins, Jack Frost, and The Gingerdead Man. Holliday horror has always been some of my favorite sub genre films to watch, particularly the many Christmas horror films that have grown in popularity in the past two decades. Today we are going to look at the film that started the trend though, Silent Night, Bloody Night. Made in 1972, and starting Andy Warhol superstars, this film really started the craze of Christmas horror filmmaking, and we are going to explore that a little here in this retrospective. Thanks for watching!
