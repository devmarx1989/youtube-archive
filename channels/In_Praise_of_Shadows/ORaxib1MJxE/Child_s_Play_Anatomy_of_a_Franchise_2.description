In today's retrospective, we breakdown every single film in the Child's Play franchise: Child's Play 1, 2, and 3, Bride of Chucky, Seed of Chucky, Curse of Chucky, and Cult of Chucky. We also talk about the upcoming syfy channel Child's Play tv show, and the 2019 Child's Play reboot. Created by Don Mancini in 1988, and starring Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly, this horror franchise has gone on for thirty years and has been one of the strongest slasher franchises started in the 1980's. Let me know any other horror franchises that you would like to see in a future breakdown, and thank you for watching.
