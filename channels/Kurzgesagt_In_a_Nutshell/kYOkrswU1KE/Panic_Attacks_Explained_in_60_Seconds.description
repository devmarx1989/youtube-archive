❓What is a panic attack?  
A panic attack is an episode where a person experiences a sudden wave of fear and anxiety, often in a situation where there is no real threat or danger. They can be triggered by stress, a shocking life event, or even too much nicotine, caffeine, or alcohol. Around one in three of you could suffer from a panic attack at least once in your life. Panic attacks are accompanied by physical signs and symptoms of anxiety and can include a rapid heart rate, feeling short of breath, feeling one is losing control, feeling detached from one’s body or reality or even feeling like one might die. Even if it feels awful, know that the panic won’t physically hurt you and that the attack will pass. 

❗Things that can help during a panic attack: 
1️⃣ Breathe.
Practice abdominal breathing: Breathe slowly from your abdomen through your nose to reduce symptoms of hyperventilation

2️⃣ Stay in the present. 
Staying in the present and focussing on external objects will help minimize the attention you might give to troublesome physical symptoms or catastrophic thoughts. If possible, you might try actually touching objects nearby to reinforce staying in the immediate present or use the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise: 5: FIVE things you see around you. 4: FOUR things you can touch around you. 3: THREE things you hear. 2: TWO things you can smell. 1: ONE thing you can taste. 

3️⃣Know it will pass. 
Even if it feels awful, know that the panic won’t physically hurt you and that the attack will pass. 

4️⃣Be kind to yourself. 
It’s okay to be scared, and you’re not alone. Practice positive self-talk and self-compassion to help reduce anxiety. You are stronger than you think and you can handle this. 💖
