If Neptune didn't catch Triton we might have another Dwarf Planet in our Solar system -- maybe even another Planet or double system. We show how this could have happened.

Ok, Moon May is over. Did you like it? Should we do something like this again? With other topics? More moons? More infographic stuff? Please tell us in the comments! :)

(Did you really think there'd be no Tardis? We are just making it harder.) (Just realized it might look terrible on some screens -- sorry. We obviously didn't think this through).
