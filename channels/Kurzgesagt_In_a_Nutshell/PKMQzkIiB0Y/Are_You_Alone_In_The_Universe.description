Are you alone? To answer this question we have to take a look what "you" are first. What are you made of and where you stand in this universe. Are you your body? Your atoms? And how are your parts connected to the big picture?

Special thanks to James Gurney for checking out our script. Take a look at his youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/JimtheEvo 

Videos, explaining things. Like evolution, time, space, global energy or our existence in this strange universe. 
We are a team of designers, journalists and musicians who want to make science look beautiful. Because it is beautiful.
