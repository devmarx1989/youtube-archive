Fentanyl is the deadliest illegal drug in US history by far. It’s often described as the ultimate high, but it’s actually an inferior, short-lived, and brutally addictive version of heroin. In this video, we explore what opioids do to your brain and body, what it feels like to take them, and why so many people are dying from Fentanyl overdoses without ever choosing to take it.
