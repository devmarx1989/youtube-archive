How much time do you have left?

Time makes sense in small pieces. But when you look at huge stretches of time, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So we teamed up with the awesome blog "Wait but Why" and made this video to help you putting things in perspective with some infographics! 

This video has been a collaboration of KURZGESAGT & WAITBUTWHY!

You can get the MUSIC of this video here: http://bit.ly/1dUEBwI .The "Album" includes two versions: the original version from the video and a more "songish" version. Thomas will receive all of the the revenue, so you'll support the artist responsible directly. :)

Short videos, explaining things. For example Evolution, the Universe, Time, the Stock Market or controversial topics like Fracking. Because we love science.

We would love to interact more with you, our viewers to figure out what topics you want to see. If you have a suggestion for future videos or feedback, drop us a line! :D
