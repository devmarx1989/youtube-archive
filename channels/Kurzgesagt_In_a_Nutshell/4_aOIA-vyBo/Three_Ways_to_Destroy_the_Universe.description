How will the Universe die? 

Everybody dies. The universe too? Well, probably. What are the current theories about the end of everything? And how creepy exactly are these theories? (Spoiler: very creepy). But there might be hope...

Next Video: March 3rd. Topic: The Big Bang (which concludes our mini series about the universe)

Short videos, explaining things. For example Evolution, the Universe, Time, the Stock Market or controversial topics like Fracking. Because we love science.

We would love to interact more with you to figure out what topics you want to see. If you have a suggestion for future videos or feedback, drop us a line! :D

We're a bunch of Information designers from munich, visit us on twitter, facebook or behance to say hi!
