Time travel is possible. In fact, you’ve been doing it since the day you were born. But what if we told you there’s a way to hack the universe and manipulate time itself? 
We just have to do two simple things to make it happen: 
1. Make a lot of physicists grumpy. 
2. Shoot one twin through space against their will, while the other chills on Earth. 
Let's go!
