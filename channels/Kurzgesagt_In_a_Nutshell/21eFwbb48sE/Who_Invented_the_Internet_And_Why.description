Nuclear war, cat gifs and reddit?  Wait, what?

Who was the genius who came up with all of that? The internet is such a crucial tool in our daily lives today that we hardly remember that it hasn't been here forever. But yeah, it is actually not that old. We still have fuzzy memories about the time before the first thing in the morning was to check email and browse our favorite blogs and youtube channels. Well, let's explore how the internet came into existence and why. 

And another Kurzgesagt video that isn't depressing! Don't get used to it though. 

We funny comments at the end of the video are real comments from real people, from old YGS Episodes from Jacksfilms: youtube.com/jacksfilms

Thanks to Max from Moby Digg for the cat ;)

Next Video: May. Topic: Nuclear Energy 

Videos, explaining things. Like evolution, time, space, global energy or our existence in this strange universe. 
We are a team of designers, journalists and musicians who want to make science look beautiful. Because it is beautiful.
