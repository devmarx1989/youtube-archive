Learn about the role of the sea in global warming.

The global conveyer belt is part of the large-scale ocean circulation that is driven by differences in the density of the waters. It plays a key role in keeping the climate at balance and Europe warm. Global warming may change it forever with unforeseeable consequences. 

Short videos, explaining things. For example Evolution, the Universe, Stock Market or controversial topics like Fracking. Because we love science.

We would love to interact more with you, our viewers to figure out what topics you want to see. If you have a suggestion for future videos or feedback, drop us a line! :)
