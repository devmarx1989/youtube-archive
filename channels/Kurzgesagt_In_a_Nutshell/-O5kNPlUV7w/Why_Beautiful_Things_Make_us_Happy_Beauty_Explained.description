It’s hard to define what makes something beautiful, but we seem to know beauty when we see it. Why is that and how does beauty affect our subconscious?

This video was a collaboration with the creative agency Sagmeister & Walsh as a contribution to their upcoming Beauty exhibition at the MAK Vienna from October 23rd onwards. If you want to learn more about the impact of beauty and see tons of gorgeous installations and multi-media objects, go check it out on https://www.mak.at/en_sagmeister_walsh
The Beauty exhibition will also be shown in the Museum Angewandte Kunst Frankfurt from May 11th till September 15th.
