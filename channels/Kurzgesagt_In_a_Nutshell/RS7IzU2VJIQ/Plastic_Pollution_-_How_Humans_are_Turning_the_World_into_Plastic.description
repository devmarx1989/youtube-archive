Modern life would be impossible without plastic – but we have long since lost control over our invention. Why has plastic turned into a problem and what do we know about its dangers? 

This video is a collaboration with UN Environment and their Clean Seas campaign, If you want to take action to turn the tide on plastics, go to http://www.cleanseas.org and make your pledge.

We also partnered with askscience on reddit – on https://bit.ly/2tVU68d you can talk to experts and ask questions about about plastic pollution today!
