How did everything get started? 

Has the universe a beginning or was it here since forever? Well, evidence suggests that there was indeed a starting point to this universe we are part of right now. But how can this be? How can something come from nothing? And what about time? We don't have all the answers yet so let's talk about what we know.

Also, we try to make this one not depressing. Tell us if we succeeded. 

BY THE WAY. We have a website now. We'll try to blog from time to time, show you guys how we make the videos and give more insight to our process. Also we sell stuff. We really don't know where this whole kurzgesagt stuff leads us. But we are really thankful for all the attention and positive feedback and yeah, maybe we can make this our jobs -- it would be pretty nice and we could do more content each month. But we'll see. For now, thank you very much everybody for making this little adventure possible.

Thomas did an aweful good job again. :)

Next Video: April. (as soon as we can but we kind of have to make a living and visit college) Topic: Nuclear Energy (probably, if we finish the research in time -- if not something else)

Short videos, explaining things. For example Evolution, the Universe, Time, the Stock Exchange or controversial topics like Fracking. Because we love science.
