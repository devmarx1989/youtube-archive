We want to share a special story with you: 
kurzgesagt began as a small passion project, but thanks to your support through our shop, we’ve been able to grow and keep making inspiring science videos which remain free for everyone. 
From our Human Era Calendar to posters, plushies, and everything in between, every purchase helps us bring more knowledge to the world. Thank you so much for your support!
