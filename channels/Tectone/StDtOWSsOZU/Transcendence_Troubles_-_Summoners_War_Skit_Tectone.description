Hey guys,  I really hope you enjoyed the video. Doing this was a lot of fun and I really hope you'll share your thoughts about it and subscribe to see what more I have to offer in the future. 

Honestly, I can't wait to do more things like this and just have as much of a variety surrounding my content as possible.

Last thing, I really hope you will consider joining the discord :) I absolutely love talking to people so I hope I get to meet ya sometime and hang out. discord.gg/guyEjDK

Also my wife makes all the thumbnails and art for this channel :) I'd love if you could see more of her work she's honestly great https://mobile.twitter.com/justfream
