Hey folks :D This is my first video and a series that I've been thinking about making for a while. Summoners war means a lot to me and I am very passionate about it so taking any opportunity to try and rally the community together to improve Summoners War I want to take.

Anywho, I'm like super looking for feedback for this video so the more y'all can give me your thoughts the better. I really hope y'all enjoyed this or if it made you do some thinking then I'm a happy boi. 

Join The discord that's posted in the video itself! I really wanna meet some cool folk.

Music used: Bob-omb Battlefield Super Mario 64 Extended by Nintendo
